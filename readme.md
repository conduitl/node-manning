##Concepts to follow up on:

###Chapter 4
* JSON body parsing
* form encoded bodies
* ORM

The TLDR example in this chapter has been growing on me. I've completed the example and would like to explore it further, building on it and tweaking it to solve various problems. It uses the SQLite3 database which is worth exploring. Notably, Ghost, my blogging platform also relies on SQLite last time I checked. 

###Chapter 5 - Front-end build systems
Covers some introductory elements to Gulp and Webpack. I'll need to review the differences between the use cases for each system. Gulp appears to be a good fit for my FS-Guide project. Angular, of course, uses Webpack, so when I dive back into my Angular 2 project, I'll need to look closer at this system. 

###Chapter 6 - Server-side Frameworks
Includes an interesting overview of various server-side frameworks; however, it's more of a distraction for me at this point in time. My time is better spent learning the in and outs of core Node modules and the Connect and Express libraries. Later on, I may want to look at Koa, Hapi, and Kraken, but now's not the time. 

###Chapter 7 - Connect and Express in Depth
